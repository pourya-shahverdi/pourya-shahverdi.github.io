    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

As a Robotics Engineer with +10 years of experience in various domains (Humanoid, Dynamic and Control, Navigation), my current research interests include Behavior Perception, Affective Computing, and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

My slogan is "Social Robots for Social Justice." 

I aim to understand Social HRI's mechanisms and nuances to develop reliable and transparent conversational AI models for Embodied Conversational Agents (e.g., Robots, Avatars). I firmly believe that an artificial agent can truly connect with humans only when equipped with a certain level of human-like emotional intelligence. Consequently, leveraging foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), my Ph.D. dissertation focuses on developing context-aware affective conversational AIs. My goal is to enhance naturalness, trust, and empathy by fostering stronger bonds between users and agents. This will be achieved through context awareness and emotionally appropriate verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
