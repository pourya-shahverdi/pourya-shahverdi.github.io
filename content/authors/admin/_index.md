#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oakland University, expected to graduate in April 2025. I also lecture at the School of Engineering and Computer Science and serve as a graduate research assistant under Prof. [Geoffrey Louie](https://www.geoffrey-louie.com/) in the IRL¬≤ Intelligent Robotics Laboratory.

<!-- As a Robotics Engineer with more than 10 years of experience across various domains, including Dynamics, Control, Manipulation, and Navigation, my research currently focuses on Social Robot Learning and its dimensions, including Affective Computing, Behavior Perception, Conversational AI/ML, and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). I publish my work in top-tier conferences and journals. -->
My research focuses on imitation learning, affective computing, behavior perception, conversational AI/ML, and human factor design for human-robot interaction (HRI/HCI/HMI). I have over 10 years of experience in robotics and accomplished projects in kinematics/dynamics modeling and control, humanoid imitation, manipulation and visual servoing, mobile robot navigation, and autonomous vehicles. I also served as a mentor for K12 students in RoboCup competitions, and achieved world-class honors.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball, hiking, helping my wife with her bakery, and playing the Piano/Keyboard as well as Tar/Setar (traditional Persian instruments).
