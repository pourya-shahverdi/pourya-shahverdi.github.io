#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

<!-- I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oakland University, Michigan. I work as a graduate Research Assistant under Prof. [Geoffrey Louie](https://www.geoffrey-louie.com/) in the [IRL¬≤](https://www.linkedin.com/company/irl2): In Real-Life Intelligent Robotics Laboratory. -->

<!-- As a Robotics Engineer with more than 10 years of experience across various domains, including Dynamics, Control, Manipulation, and Navigation, my research currently focuses on Social Robot Learning and its dimensions, including Affective Computing, Behavior Perception, Conversational AI/ML, and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). I publish my work in top-tier conferences and journals. -->
I‚Äôm Pourya Shahverdi, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oakland University and a researcher at the In Real-Life Intelligent Robotics Laboratory (IRL)¬≤. My work focuses on the intersection of social robotics, affective computing, and human-AI interaction, with an emphasis on building emotionally intelligent and context-aware AI systems.

I develop embodied conversational agents such as social robots and virtual avatars that can understand, adapt to, and influence human behavior in socially and emotionally meaningful ways. By integrating insights from psychology, communication science, and behavioral analysis into machine learning and affective computing models, I aim to achieve human-level expressivity and responsiveness in artificial agents. My research addresses real-world challenges across various domains, including education, healthcare, marketing, customer service, and human resource development.

My long-term vision is to create social robot and AI agents that are not only visually charming but also emotionally responsive, socially intelligent, and physically reliable. I believe that for AI to be truly impactful, it must engage with humans on both cognitive and emotional levels reliably.

If you are interested in socially intelligent AI, affective computing, or human-robot interaction, feel free to reach out. I welcome opportunities for collaboration, discussion, and innovation.
