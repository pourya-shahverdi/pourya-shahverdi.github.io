      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        "Social Robots for Social Justice" is my slogan.
      
        I strive to uncover the complexities of Social HRI to create reliable and transparent conversational AI models for robots and virtual agents. I believe that true human connection with artificial agents is only possible when they possess a degree of human-like emotional intelligence. My Ph.D. dissertation leverages foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop context-aware affective conversational AIs. Through this work, I aim to enhance naturalness, trust, and empathy, fostering meaningful interactions between users and agents. Ultimately, I hope my efforts advance social justice by making high-quality social services, like healthcare and education, more accessible to underrepresented communities.
