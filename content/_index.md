      title: 'ðŸ“š My Mission'
      subtitle: ''

        "Social Robots for Social Justice" is my slogan.
      
        I strive to uncover the complexities of Social HRI to create reliable and transparent behavior models for robots and autonomous agents. I believe that true human connection with artificial agents is only possible when they possess a degree of human-like emotional intelligence. My dissertation focuses on developing emotionally context-aware verbal and nonverbal behavior models for social robots and autonomous agents to enhance empathy, engagement, and efficacy in human-agent interactions. 
        
        My research involves designing and conducting user studies to explore the nuances and dynamics of both group and one-on-one interactions, employing quantitative and qualitative analyses of objective and subjective measurements derived from behavioral observations and multimodal sensory signals. Grounded in affective and cognitive theories, I leverage multimodal AI approaches to model context, user affective states, and cognitive processes,enabling the generation of emotionally context-aware agent behaviors for real-world social HRI applications. 
        
        My work has been applied to social HRI applications in autism therapy, physical therapy, and education, leading to publications in top-tier venues such as ICRA, IROS, and RO-MAN. Ultimately, I hope my efforts advance social justice by making high-quality social services, like healthcare and education, more accessible to underrepresented communities.
